# Resume Classifier & Job Market Insights (NLP Project)

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies resumes into job categories using machine learning and extracts key insights from resume text. This project is designed to help recruiters and HR professionals automatically categorize and analyze resume data for better decision-making.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 📂 **Input**: Resume texts and their corresponding job categories
- 🧠 **Tech**: NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF, and classification models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)
- 📊 **Output**: Resume classification + data visualizations for job market trends

---

## 📌 Goals

- Build a machine learning pipeline to classify resumes into categories
- Apply NLP techniques to clean and process real-world textual data
- Visualize common skills and trends across different job roles
- Make the project publicly available to contribute to an open-source portfolio

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   Used publicly available resume dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/resume-dataset)

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal  
   - Stopwords removal  
   - Text normalization with NLTK

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   - TF-IDF vectorization of cleaned text

4. **Modeling** *(Coming Soon)*  
   - Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest classifiers

5. **Evaluation & Visualization** *(Coming Soon)*  
   - Classification metrics: accuracy, F1-score  
   - Insights using word clouds & bar charts of skills per role

---

## 📈 Example Insights (Coming Soon)

- Most common skills per job title
- Resume classification accuracy per category
- Resume keyword visualizations
